## IPU College Ranking System

This project aims to build a **comprehensive college ranking system for Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (IPU)** based on multiple factors such as placements, faculty, infrastructure, student reviews, and academic performance.

The current module focuses on **placement data parsing and normalization**, which extracts placement statistics from PDF reports of various IPU-affiliated colleges, cleans the data, and stores it in a structured format. This forms the foundation for calculating **placement-based rankings**.

Future modules will include:

* Academic performance analysis
* Infrastructure & facilities evaluation
* Student feedback integration
* Final college ranking dashboard

**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL/PostgreSQL, PDFBox, REST API.
